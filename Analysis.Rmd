Breaking data down by party and gender

```{r Summary Statistics} 

anti_a <- read_dta("data/anti_abort replication leg_party_compet 28Jan20.dta")
# Subsets of the data potentially for future use
women <- subset(anti_a, Female == 1)
men <- subset(anti_a, Female == 0)
republicans <- subset(anti_a, party == "R")
democrats <- subset(anti_a, party == "D")

# ideology scale summary 
summary(anti_a$np_score_2)

# population proportions of party and gender

table(anti_a$Female, anti_a$party)
prop.table(table(anti_a$Female, anti_a$party))



# setting types within gender party so I can use this later
anti_a$gender_party <- NA
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 1 & anti_a$party == "D"] <- "Dem. Woman"
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 1 & anti_a$party == "R"] <- "Rep. Woman"
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 0 & anti_a$party == "D"] <- "Dem. Man"
anti_a$gender_party[anti_a$Female == 0 & anti_a$party == "R"] <- "Rep. Man"

```

##  Plots

```{r Main Plots, echo=FALSE}

Here I take some regressions of quantities of interest and did some preliminary interpretations, that candidly, I am very unsure about. 

```{r Regressions}
# regress both gender and party onto bill votes

# What resonates most by gender? (unsure if these should be proportions 
# or probabilities)

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$Female)
# unsure of the order here, but I might interpret this one as 23% of males having 
# voted for at least one anti-abortion bill. 

gender_all_fit <- lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$Female)
# males are four percent more likely to have voted for at least 
# one anti abortion bill. or among males, the prop that has
# supported a bill as such is ~ 4 percent 


gender_antiwom_fit<- lm(anti_a$bin_anti_womtot ~ anti_a$Female)
# Males are 2.3% more likely to have voted for an anti abortion 
# bill that was pro-woman and pro-life

gender_antirelig_fit <- lm(anti_a$bin_anti_relig ~ anti_a$Female)
# males are 1.7% more likely to have voted for an anti abortion bill 
# that adheres to a religious or moral issue frame

gender_antifetus_fit <- lm(anti_a$bin_anti_fetus ~ anti_a$Female)
#males are 1.3% more likely to have votes for an anti abortion bill that 
# adheres to a fetal centric issue frame

# What resonates most by ideology?

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$np_score_2)
# if you increase the np score by one unit, the probability of voting for an 
# anti abortion bill would be a difference of 3.6 percentage points -> more 
# conservative, more likely to vote for anti abortion bill at some point 

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_womtot ~ anti_a$np_score_2)
# if you increase the np score by one unit, the probability of voting for an 
# anti abortion bill would be a difference of 2.4 percentage points
# more conservative --> more likely to vote for a pro-life framed
# anit abortion bill than any other type of anti abortion bill

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_relig ~ anti_a$np_score_2)
# if you increase the np score by one unit, the probability of voting for an 
# anti abortion bill would be a difference of 1.5 percentage points

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_fetus ~ anti_a$np_score_2)
## if you increase the np score by one unit, the probability of voting for an 
# anti abortion bill would be a difference of 1.2 percentage points

# What resonates most by party?

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$party)
# r = .05545, is highest out of all parties

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_relig ~ anti_a$party)
# r = 0.0248, is highest out of all parties, independent is slightly negative
# and d = .004485

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_fetus ~ anti_a$party)
# r = .020949, highest of all again, I is negative and d is positive but 
# closer to zero

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_womtot ~ anti_a$party)
# I = .039299, I is surprisingly the highest here, followed by R, and then D

lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$rep_control)

fit_g_party <- lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$Female + anti_a$party)

ideology_fit <- lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$np_score_2)

boxplot(anti_a$Female, anti_a$np_score_2,
        names = c("Female", "Male"),
        ylab = "Ideology Score",
        xlab = "Sex")

complex <- lm(anti_a$bin_anti_all ~ anti_a$party + anti_a$Female + anti_a$competitive)
complex


stargazer::stargazer(fit_g_party, title = "Gender and Party",
                     covariate.labels = c("Gender (Female)", "Party"),
                     dep.var.labels = "Sponsorship of at least one anti-abortion bill",
                     header = FALSE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
